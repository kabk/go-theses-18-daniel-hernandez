### Please be patient, I'm still learning.
#### Use cases and implications of machine learning technology in graphic design

#### Abstract
As artificial intelligence rapidly expands towards new areas, it is essential for graphic designers to learn about this topic and understand its potential implications. It is still very unclear what these emerging technologies might be able to achieve in a creative field like graphic design, given that it is very difficult to emulate a form of human creativity that is able to transform, combine and explore a vast conceptual space, like graphic designers do. This thesis aims to envision what might be possible through machine learning in the future, and specifically through which methods this might be achieved.

Developing an artificial intelligence capable of autonomous design is a very difficult problem, because graphic design, and especially â€œgood graphic design" is an intrinsically subjective and abstract concept which is very difficult to quantify and fully automate. This thesis aims to examine to what extent this kind of autonomous design is possible, how it might be achieved, and what this achievement would imply.

This research is mostly carried out through experimentation with several existing technologies like deep neural networks, generative adversarial networks and genetic algorithms, evaluating their capabilities as well as their limitations to perform the tasks of a graphic designer. The use of these technologies in the area of graphic design remains virtually unexplored, which is why a deeper understanding of their capabilities could point out how we could adapt to the major changes that are likely to occur to the discipline of graphic design in the near future.
